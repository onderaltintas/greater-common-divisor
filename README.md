# greater-common-divisor
Function that finds the greater common divisor of array of numbers. Everyone can use it for every legal purposes. You don't have to ask for using it, just use it and if it helps you and one day if you become rich because of greater-common-divisor... Then you can buy me a Ferrari F50.
